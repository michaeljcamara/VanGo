# Description of Roles

## Francis Craft
Francis was responsible for initially meeting with the customer, and later performing the full analysis of the system.

## Herbie Torrance
Herbie created the requirements document and performed manual testing of the system.

## Alex Means
Alex created the written description of the system's design, in addition to an overall diagram of the design.

## Cathal Chaffee
Cathal was responsible for the implementation of VanGo, particularly for developing the ShuttleVanTable Google Doc integration.

## Victor Zheng
Victor was also responsible for the implementation of VanGo, particularly for developing several utility functions for the ShuttleVanCalendar Google Calendar integration.

## Michael Camara
Michael was the project manager for the VanGo team.  He coordinated meetings with team members and attempted to keep everyone on schedule.  He investigated the feasibility of using Google Apps Script, which was eventually chosen for the implementation task.  He created the new ShuttleVanForm and developed the framework of the VanGo system using the Apps Script.  He further maintained communication with the customer to clarify various questions and properly validate the system as it was being created.  Ultimately, he devised and implemented the primary algorithm for automatically scheduling student events on the ShuttleVanCalendar.  He then lead the demonstration of the near-final system for the customer on 12/9/15, and created the ReadMe file to further explain the system and how to operate it.

## Tool Support
Our team utilized the Google Apps Script for implementation of this system, in addition to integrating the system with the Google line of products (Google Forms, Google Calendars, Google Docs, and Google Sheets).  This approach was chosen in order to automate the scheduling process as much as possible, causing all important steps to occur in real-time, and only rarely requiring intervention from the customer.
