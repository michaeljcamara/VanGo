VanGo Design Narrative

As our project was built with efficiency and eloquence in mind, the design of the system at a high level is fairly straightforward. Everything about the project begins with a Google Form. This form, to be completed by a signed-in student so that they may edit it later if necessary, asks the student various questions about their basic information. We keep the ridesâ€™ potential start times to every 15 minutes in order to standardize when rides are undertaken and prevent any unnecessary complications. When the requested times are submitted with the form, we go straight to our Google Calendar of events. If there is no time conflict, the calendar is simply updated and a schedule confirmation is sent to the student. In the case of a conflict, we merely notify the student via email that there was a time conflict. We provide various alternative time suggestions and invite the student to edit their form. The form they access is the same form as the previous, and the student merely needs to change the time field and resubmit. At that point, the schedule is updated and the standard time confirmation is sent. This process is repeated for every form sent, and thus our calendar is populated with events.

For a high-level overview of this system, please refer to our design diagram.
